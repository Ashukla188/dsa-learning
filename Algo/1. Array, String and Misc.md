# Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array. It works in linear time, making it ideal for large arrays.

<b><u>Key Idea</u></b>

1. Traverse the array while keeping track of:
   - The current subarray sum `currentSum`.
   - The maximum subarray sum seen so far `maxSum`.
2. At each step:
   - Add the current element to `currentSum`.
   - If `currentSum` becomes negative, reset it to `0` (since a negative sum would not contribute positively to subsequent sums).
   - Update `maxSum` to the larger of itself or `currentSum`.

```c++
int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxSum = nums[0]; // Initialize maxSum with the first element
    int currentSum = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        currentSum += num; // Add current element to currentSum
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum); // Update maxSum if needed
        if (currentSum < 0) {
            currentSum = 0; // Reset currentSum if it goes negative
        }
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

# Sliding Window Technique

Sliding Window problems are problems in which a fixed or variable-size window is moved through a data structure, typically an array or string, to solve problems efficiently based on continuous subsets of elements. This technique is used when we need to find subarrays or substrings according to a given set of conditions.

1. **Fixed-Size Sliding Window:** The window size remains constant as it slides across the array. This is useful for problems where you need to compute something over every subarray of size `k`.
   - Initialize the window with the first k elements.
   - Slide the window by removing the element going out of the window and adding the next element coming into the window.
   - Perform the required calculation during each slide.
2. **Variable-Size Sliding Window:** The window size adjusts dynamically based on problem constraints, like finding the - shortest or longest subarray satisfying a condition.
   - Start with two pointers (start and end), both at the beginning.
   - Expand the end pointer to include more elements in the window.
   - Shrink the start pointer when the condition is violated.
   - Track the result during expansion and/or contraction.

# Two Pointer Technique

The Two Pointer technique is a versatile method used to solve problems on arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers that traverse the data structure either in the same or opposite directions to find solutions efficiently.

**Opposite Direction (Bidirectional):** One pointer starts at the beginning, and the other at the end. They move toward each other to find pairs or conditions involving elements from both ends. Use Case: Sorting, pair sum, palindrome checking.
**Same Direction (Unidirectional):** Both pointers start at the same position and move forward, often used for subarray problems. Use Case: Sliding window problems, finding subarrays, or segments satisfying conditions.

<b>

ðŸŽˆ Whenever question says that array consists of integers from 0 to n, most of the times trick is to use index.

ðŸŽˆ If asked to pick longest subarray in a binary array with equal 0s and 1s, replace 0s with -1s. Then question becomes longest subarray with sum = 0.

ðŸŽˆ When question is asked about odds/evens in array, mostly the trick is to replace all items by item % 2.
