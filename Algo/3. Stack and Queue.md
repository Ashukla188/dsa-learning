# STACKS & QUEUES

---

## 🔍 Theory + Patterns (Use During Interview Revision)
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

A Queue Data Structure follows the principle of "First in, First out" (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

## 🧮 Classic Stack Applications

### 🔸 Infix, Prefix, Postfix

- **Infix**: `(A + B)`  
  ➤ Standard notation we use, needs precedence & associativity handling.

- **Prefix (Polish Notation)**: `+ A B`  
  ➤ Operator before operands, evaluated **right to left** using stack.

- **Postfix (Reverse Polish)**: `A B +`  
  ➤ Operator after operands, evaluated **left to right** using stack.



### 🧠 Stack Patterns & Where to Use:

- **Monotonic Stack** (increasing/decreasing): Used in *next greater/smaller element* type problems.
- Use stacks when:
  1️⃣ You need to **track previous elements** with potential backtracking.  
  2️⃣ The problem involves **"opening" and "closing" structures** (like parentheses, tags, spans).  
  3️⃣ You are converting a **recursive logic** into an **iterative approach**.  
  4️⃣ You need to **remove elements in LIFO order** while still tracking ongoing state.  
  5️⃣ You want to maintain **min/max** efficiently → use **two stacks** (Min Stack problem).

> ✨ **Monotonic Stack** or **Deque** is crucial when maintaining strictly increasing/decreasing sequences (like histograms, sliding windows, etc.).

### 🧠 Queue Patterns & Where to Use:

- Queues help in:
  - Simulating **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** processes
  - Handling **sliding window maximum/minimum** efficiently (often with Deques)
  - **Round-robin** processing (e.g., ticket counters, task scheduling)
  - **BFS-type problems**, task prioritization, etc.

## 🔥 Noteworthy Tips

- Use `stack<pair<int, int>>` or `deque<pair<int, int>>` to track both **value and index**.
- Always check if **monotonicity** (increasing/decreasing) is required for stack/queue problems.
- Don’t forget edge cases like **empty stack/queue** and **overflow/underflow** in implementation.
- Use **two stacks** to simulate a queue, or vice versa.
