## üìö Hashmap Theory & Revision Notes

### What is a Hashmap?
- A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- Provides average **O(1)** time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

---

### Why Use Hashmaps?
- Fast lookup of data.
- Handling dynamic sets where elements are added and removed.
- Counting frequencies of elements.
- Detecting duplicates efficiently.
- Implementing caching (e.g., LRU Cache).

---

### Common Use Cases of Hashmaps in Coding Interviews

1. **Frequency Counting**
   - Count occurrences of elements in arrays or strings.
   - Example: "First Unique Character", "Single Number".

2. **Two Sum / Pair Problems**
   - Find pairs with a given sum using a hashmap to store complements.
   - Example: "Key Pair", "Max Points on a Line".

3. **Substring/Window Problems**
   - Use hashmap to track counts of characters in sliding windows.
   - Example: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters".

4. **Prefix Sum & Subarray Problems**
   - Use hashmap to store prefix sums and their indices to find zero sum subarrays or subarrays with sum K.
   - Example: "Subarray with 0 sum", "Largest Subarray with 0 sum".

5. **Set Operations**
   - Use hashset (special case of hashmap) to check existence, remove duplicates.
   - Example: "Longest Consecutive Sequence".

6. **Advanced Patterns**
   - Mapping complex objects as keys (strings, tuples).
   - Palindrome pairs involving hashing of substrings.
   - Example: "Palindrome Pairs".

### Important Techniques & Tips

- **Handling Collisions:** Understand chaining vs open addressing (mostly abstracted by language libs).
- **Custom Hashing:** For objects or composite keys, implement `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods (in languages like Python).
- **Sliding Window + Hashmap:** Maintain frequency maps and adjust window size dynamically.
- **Bit Manipulation with Hashing:** For problems like "Single Number III", XOR can be used as a lightweight hash.
- **Hashmap & Geometry:** Slope calculations stored in hashmaps to find max points on a line.

---

### Common Pitfalls

- Watch out for mutability of keys (strings and tuples are safe, lists are not).
- Handle large input sizes; always consider space/time trade-offs.
- Beware of integer overflow in custom hash functions.
- Edge cases with empty inputs or all duplicates.
