# üìö Heap (Priority Queue) ‚Äî Curated Theory & Questions

## üî∞ What is a Heap?

A **Heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:
- **Min Heap:** Parent node is smaller than children ‚Üí Top element is the minimum.
- **Max Heap:** Parent node is larger than children ‚Üí Top element is the maximum.

### STL & Language Implementations
- **C++**
  - Max Heap: `priority_queue<int>`
  - Min Heap: `priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>`
- **Python**
  - Min Heap: `heapq` (default)
  - Max Heap: Push negative values or use tuples
- **Java**
  - Min Heap: `PriorityQueue<Integer>`
  - Max Heap: `PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder())`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Heap Use Cases & Patterns

| Use Case                                 | Heap Type    | Pattern Description                                                  |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| K largest/smallest elements              | Min/Max Heap | Maintain heap of size K                                               |
| Top K frequent elements/words            | Max Heap     | Use frequency map with custom comparator                             |
| Streaming median                         | 2 Heaps      | Max heap (left), Min heap (right)                                    |
| Merging sorted arrays/lists              | Min Heap     | Store elements with origin indices                                   |
| Greedy next optimal task/item            | Max/Min Heap | Frequently in scheduling or refueling problems                       |
| Custom sorting based on complex criteria | Heap         | Use custom comparator (e.g., lexical order, frequency, etc.)         |
| Sort nearly sorted array                 | Min Heap     | Insert first K+1 elements and pop min                                 |

## üß† Identifying Heap Problems

### üìå Keywords to Watch For:
- "Top K..."
- "Minimum/Largest..."
- "Frequent elements"
- "Dynamically find median"
- "Refuel optimally"
- "Merge sorted..."
- "Schedule with priority"

## üß† Notes & Reminders

- Use **min heap** when tracking the largest `k` items.
- Use **max heap** when tracking the smallest `k` items (by pushing negatives).
- For **multi-field comparisons**, use **tuples or structs** with custom comparators.
- In two-heap solutions, balance both heaps after every insertion.

### üìé Pattern Recognition:

| Pattern                                 | Strategy                     |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| "Top/Smallest/Largest K"                | Min/Max Heap (size K)        |
| "Most/Least Frequent"                   | Frequency map + Heap         |
| "Median in stream"                      | Two Heaps (max & min)        |
| "Merge K sorted lists/arrays"           | Min Heap of first elements   |
| "Greedy decision with priority"         | Heap based on criteria       |
| "Sort nearly sorted array"              | Min Heap of size K+1         |
