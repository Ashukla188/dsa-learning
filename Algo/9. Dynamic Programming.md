Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. DP is particularly useful when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, meaning that an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Types of Dynamic Programming Approaches</h3>

<b style="color:DarkKhaki;">Memoization (Top-Down):</b>

- In this approach, the problem is solved by breaking it down recursively.
- We use a table (often a dictionary or an array) to store the result of each subproblem. Before computing a subproblem, we check if its result is already stored. If it is, we use that stored result instead of recalculating it.
- This saves computation time but keeps the recursive structure of the solution.

<u>Example: Fibonacci sequence with memoization.</u>

```c++
unordered_map<int, int> memo;

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) { return n; }
    if (memo.find(n) != memo.end()) { return memo[n]; }
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    return memo[n];
}
```

<b style="color:DarkKhaki;">Tabulation (Bottom-Up):</b>

- In the tabulation method, we solve the subproblems iteratively, starting with the smallest subproblems and building up to the solution of the original problem.
- We fill out a table in a bottom-up manner, which allows us to avoid recursion altogether.

<u>Example: Fibonacci sequence with tabulation.</u>

```c++
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) { return n; }
    vector<int> fib(n + 1);
    fib[0] = 0; fib[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
      fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
    return fib[n];
}
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Steps to solve a DP problem</h3>

1. **Define the Recurrence Relation:** <span style="color: Coral;">Always remember that DP is nothing but enhanced recursion! Simply when there is overlapping problem in recursion, it is DP!</span>

    - Express the solution to a subproblem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems.
    - This relation should capture the optimal choice at each step.
    - For example, in the Knapsack problem, the recurrence relation might be: `dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], val[i-1] + dp[i-1][w-wt[i-1]])`

2. **Identify the Base Cases:**

    - Determine the simplest subproblems that can be solved directly.
    - These are the boundary conditions for the recurrence relation.

3. **Choose an Approach:**

    - Top-Down (Memoization):
        - Start with the original problem and recursively break it down into smaller subproblems.
        - Store the solutions to subproblems in a memoization table to avoid redundant calculations.
    - Bottom-Up (Tabulation):
        - Start with the simplest subproblems and solve them directly.
        - Store the solutions to subproblems in a table.
        - Solve larger subproblems by combining the solutions to smaller subproblems, using the values stored in the table.

<span style="color: Cyan;">Dynamic programming problems identification: Choices can be there, or optimal solution asked (max/min/largest/smallest), or multiple recursive calls are there (that are overlapping) </span>

- For recursive approach to DP, your recursive function should return something! 
- Also try to keep the number of arguments in recursive function as less as possible!
